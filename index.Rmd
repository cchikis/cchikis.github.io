Thank you for visiting my website. I am a senior research assistant at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I work in the Macro-financial Analysis (MFA) section in Monetary Affairs (MA). My long-term plan is to earn a PhD in Economics and drive a research agenda centered on macroeconomics, growth, innovation, and macro-labor.


I don't like sharing pictures of myself as my Facebook, LinkedIn, and this website will attest. However, I have been informed this website looks rather drab without a personal photograph. Here is a picture of Jean Valjean, the protagonist of _Les Mis√©rables_ by Victor Hugo (1862), disguised under the false identity of Monsieur Madeleine, the mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Illustration by Gustave Brion.
